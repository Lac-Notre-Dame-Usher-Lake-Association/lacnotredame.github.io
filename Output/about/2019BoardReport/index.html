We discussed this year's overall higher E-Coli results, particularly at locations 1 and 9B, and higher phosphorus/phosphates result at location 6. It's possible that firepit ash could be contributing, since phosphate-detergents were removed from the market several years ago. The E-Coli may be the geese or beavers, as beavers are active in the area around location 1.</li><li>Milfoil is generally lower this year, and native weeds have taken its place in some locations, particularly off the Bishop's Manor point. Buoys were not placed out this year as the milfoil levels were so low. The eastern end of the lake has more milfoil than the western end although in most places it has not reached the surface. We discussed cutting and the importance of removal of the cuttings. There are cutter recommendations on the web site, and Danielle offered that people could borrow her cutter if they wished. Lisa will add that to the website.</li><li>Biologist Paul Hamilton reviews the reports and implications. This year, he warns us to watch for Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria), which may take the ecological niche the milfoil was holding. He suggested that high water in the spring and through July contributed to the decreased milfoil.</li></ul><h2>Board report of program for 2018-2019</h2><ul><li>Develop a position and understand full costs, responsibilities and benefits of joining Quebec’s- Réseau de surveillance volontaire des lacs (RSVL) - Voluntary Lake Monitoring Network</li><li>Position: do not join</li><li>Costs $476 per year, only tests 1 location – we test 15 for more chemicals</li><li>Requires clarity testing every 2 weeks from May to October (!! Who would volunteer to do this??) – we test once/twice per year and find very little variability</li><li>RSVL does not test for e-coli – only for phosphorus (we test for this), chlorophyll and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) – neither of which we currently test for.</li><li>Action Lisa: find out how much it would cost to add a Chlorophyll and DOC test for one sample. Estimate is $40 for Dissolved Organic Carbon</li><li>Decide whether to maintain Facebook page now that new web site is up</li><li>NO – 2017 was last notification. Suggest taking it down – or could the web site be linked. Robert should make a post with a link to the website.</li><li>Decide whether to buy a Lake Association cutter and rake that people could borrow for their property or to publish a list of who has cutters they are willing to share</li><li>We have no insurance. Instead we recommend that neighbours gather together to purchase a cutter, like the group on the peninsula did many years ago.</li><li>Produce Goose Action Plan and distribute. Search for nests in early spring.</li><li>Goose Action Plan distribution to properties with lawns &amp; no goose control is planned for late August and September. Copies were available at the meeting. Discussed talking to the woman feeding the geese at Demi Lune Lake.</li><li>Usher Lake has been naturalized – no geese this year.</li><li>Members of the Lake Association were interested in working with the Bishop's Manor Association on a boat launch solution outside of the Lake Association.</li><li>We used our new email list to ask our members to join together to work with the Bishop's Manor Association on a boat launch solution - the meeting was held earlier this summer.<ul></ul></li></ul><p>Move to accept the board and water testing report: André-Francois Girard</p><p>Seconded: Robert Boucher</p><h2>Current board and election of new members</h2><p>We request new members for the board.

Thank you Danielle!</p><h2>Members open issues</h2><p>Boat launch issue was raised and addressed by Marc Desrochers, President of the Bishop's Manor Association. Several members of the lake association met with Mr. Desrochers in June to discuss options. He has met with the Mayor of La Peche to discuss the possibility of a locked gate and fence at the causeway, where people - not lake owners - are circumventing the concrete blocks and launching small boats.<br>## Proposed Association program for 2019-2020</p><ul><li>Develop a Blue Green Algae prevention and action plan to understand, prevent and prepare if it appears (for example, add Dissolved Organic Compound test to water testing suite)</li><li>Jane Hayward suggesting investigating and prepare a hand-out/tip sheet about fire pits, and handling of ashes.</li><li>Develop a better understanding of the changing water levels and the potential impact of the new larger culverts at the outlet next spring - water levels may be lower as a result, thus bringing a surge in milfoil growth.</li></ul><p>Moved by Lisa Fast</p><p>Seconded by Erin Jamison</p><h2>Move to adjourn</h2><p>Moved by Marie Maisonneuve</p><p>Seconded by André-Francois Girard</p></div></main><div class="container"><footer id="info"><div class="container"><form action="/do/search" method="get"><fieldset><div class="row justify-content-start"><div class="col-6"><input class="form-control form-control-lg" autocomplete="off" name="q" placeholder="search lacnotredame.org" type="text"/></div><div class="col-3"><input class="btn btn-primary mb-3" type="submit" value="Search"/></div></div></fieldset></form></div><p>Contact us at: info [at] lacnotredame [dot] org</p><p><a href="/">Back to site home page</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
