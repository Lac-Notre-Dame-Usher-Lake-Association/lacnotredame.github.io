## Water quality and water levels report - Lisa Fast

* No 2025 report is available yet. Water testing will take place at the usual time of first week of August (consistent timing is important to understanding trends). Report will be sent via email and posted on this site.
  
  * Septic systems can be a source of nutrients - check your septic system -pump it out, have it inspected, repair it.   
  * maintain/enhance/restore your shoreline to a natural state to reduce harmful nutrients from being washed into the lake and to prevent geese from nesting  

* Summaries of the previous year's reports and a link to a spreadsheet of all data are posted on the [Water testing results page](https://lacnotredame.org/water/qualityreports/)

**Water levels**: * Everyone needs to be aware that Lac Notre Dame is a big lake with a single outlet, not a managed waterway. It rains - that makes levels higher, it's dry, they go down. Beavers make dams. Docks should be designed accordingly. The Dam team of volunteers monitor and remove portions of the dam at the outlet according to ministry rules:  

* *As per Quebec Ministry of Forestry, Wildlife & Park* and *Local Municipal Regulations*, Imre and the team are only permitted to slowly remove portions of the dam to prevent flooding and damage to  the ecological sensitive wetlands downstream from the rush of silt. Trespassing to destroy the dam risks flooding, and potential damage to Chemin Kalalla *.
* Trail cameras and no trespassing signs are in place. Do not trespass - the team is managing the dam.
* All of the dam team members have now signed agreements, and have "agent status" on the property, and can act on behalf of the owners with regards to the Trespass Act. A measuring stick in the water near the dam is used by the team to monitor water levels and **try as much as possible to keep a consistent level** with the level higher in spring to block some light from reaching the milfoil.
