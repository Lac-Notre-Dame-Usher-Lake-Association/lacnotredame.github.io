9.0 Members open issues


**Water levels**: * Everyone needs to be aware that Lac Notre Dame is a big lake with a single outlet, not a managed waterway. Docks should be designed accordingly. The Dam team of volunteers Imre Carlson, Denis Corbeil, Graeme Simpson and Marcel Hunton monitor and remove portions of the dam at the outlet according to minitstry rules:  

* *As per Quebec Ministry of Forestry, Wildlife & Park* and *Local Municipal Regulations*, Imre and the team are only permitted to slowly remove portions of the dam to prevent flooding and damage to  the ecological sensitive wetlands downstream from the rush of silt. Trespassing to destroy the dam risks flooding, and potential damage to Chemin Kalalla *.
* Trail cameras and no trespassing signs are in place. Do not trespass - the team is managing the dam.
* All of the dam team members have now signed agreements, and have "agent status" on the property, and can act on behalf of the owners with regards to the Trespass Act. A measuring stick in the water near the dam is used by the team to monitor water levels and try as much as possible to keep a consistent level.   
* Beaver families come and go in cycles. The water level can end up very low if the beavers don't return. When the dam is rebuilt and we have a lot of rain, the beavers will keep building as the water rises. Once the water is up and very high, it will take a while to go back down.
