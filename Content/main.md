## 2021 annual meeting will be August 21st, 10:00 am on Zoom

* [2021 Annual General Meeting Agenda](/about/2021boardreport/)
  
* [2020 Annual General Meeting Notes](/about/2020boardreport/)

## Blue-green algae warning

In early November 2020, a slick of Blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) was found in the island bay (near Ch. Corbei). Cases like this sometimes happen in the late fall. The cold temperatures cause the bacteria to float to the surface and collect into clusters. Our assisting biologist Paul Hamilton identified it under the microscope and advises us:

* If you can see a blue-green film on the surface of the water, don't touch it, and don't let your pets either. If it is near your drinking water intake, stop drinking the water. Don't swim or fish.
* Take a photo of the algae in the water, and collect a sample in a clean jar (with gloves or wash hands well afterwards).
* Put the jar in the fridge for a few hours. Common green algae will stay mixed with the water, but blue-green will float to the top. If the algae forms into a layer at the surface, it is likely to be blue-green.
* If it floated to the top, email the photo of the algae with a note about the location,  and a photo of the jar to Lisa at info@lacnotredame.org and we will arrange to drop it off or get it picked up so I can identify it under the microscope. I will then send an email bulletin to lake association members.

* Fall 2020 was a warning - we must naturalize the shoreline, prevent erosion from boat wakes,  and maintain our septic systems well to keep our lake healthier.

## [Water testing results](/water/qualityreports/)

The Association tests samples of water from the Lakes for phosphorus, nitrogen and E-coli on a regular basis. Volunteer and Lake Association member Carole Doré has collected samples for testing for over 15 years. Say Thank You when you see her!

L'association analyse régulièrement des échantillons d'eau des lacs pour le phosphore, l'azote et l'E-coli. Carole Doré collecte des échantillons pour les analyser depuis plus de 10 ans. Dites-lui merci quand vous la verrez!

***2021:***  Water testing at Lac Notre Dame and Usher took place in early August.

* [2021 results highlights and all water data back to 2004](/water/qualityreports/) and a 2014 study of the Lake ecosystem by ABV-7
* [Map of lake with water testing locations](/map/maps/)
* Association membership fees and donations fund the water testing.

## [Protect the clean water we enjoy](/water/keepclean/)

Keep our water clean. Share our tip sheet with your new neighbours and renters - binder page version available.

Gardez notre eau propre. Partagez la fiche de conseils avec vos locataires - version de la page du cartable disponible.

* [View and print tips to keep our lakes clean](/water/keepclean/) for your family and for your guests.

## [Eurasian Milfoil](/water/lnd-milfoil/) - keep your boats out of the Zombie Weed

Some years, invasive Eurasian Milfoil forms a dense carpet on the lake's surface, crowding out the indigenous plant species and harming fish. It was brought in on someone's boat or fishing equipment in the 1990's. It's a Zombie Weed: each tiny piece broken off by waves or boats can turn into a new plant. Avoid areas marked with yellow buoys that mark milfoil close to the surface.

Certaines années, le myriophylle envahissant forme un tapis dense à la surface du lac, évinçant les espèces végétales indigènes et nuisant aux poissons. Il a été introduit sur le bateau ou l'équipement de pêche de quelqu'un dans les années 1990. Chaque petit morceau brisé par les vagues ou les bateaux peut se transformer en une nouvelle plante.

## [Watershed map of Lac Notre Dame and Usher Lake](/map/maps/)

The map shows all inlets and outlets into the lakes. Lots are marked. Water testing locations are marked.

La carte montre toutes les entrées et sorties des lacs. Les lots sont marqués. Les lieux d'analyse de l'eau sont indiqués.

## [Canada Goose Action Plan](/water/gooseaction/)

An adult goose can produce as much as a kilo of poop every day, and those droppings can contaminate our water - and your property. 6 more geese hatched at the lake in 2020, thankfully fewer than in 2018 and 2019.

* Get prevention ideas for yourself and your neighbours in the [Goose Action Plan](/water/gooseaction/).

* Nous allons remettre des exemplaires du [plan d'action pour les bernaches](/water/gooseaction/) aux propriétaires.
