## Lake Association Meetings

Join us at our Annual General Meeting to share ideas and concerns about the lakes, water quality and the watershed. In 2020 we met online via Zoom, and had many more people attend than when we met in person. Given the continuing pandemic, we'll be online again this year, in August.

* Date: Saturday August 21st, 2021 on Zoom at 10:00 am
* [Updates and reports from the Annual General Meeting](../2020BoardReport/) will take place at the start of this year's meeting
* Current and previous members will be sent an email notification of the meeting and results

People from around the lakes attend the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to discuss water quality issues that have risen, to suggest changes or volunteer for a particular activity, and to vote on Association plans and board roles for the upcoming year. This is a chance to meet interested volunteers, to find out about water testing and help us plan the year's actions on milfoil, water quality, geese, and more.
