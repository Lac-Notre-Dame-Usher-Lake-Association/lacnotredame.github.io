### Water testing report

[Water testing report](/water/qualityreports/) presented by Lisa Fast

* Thank you to Carole Doré and Rejean Vaillant for their continued volunteer work on water testing. Water testing samples on Lac Notre Dame were collected August 16 and from Usher August ??.  
* The annual [Water testing report](/water/qualityreports/) is updated with detailed test results.  Brief summary here:
* At Lac Notre Dame: Phosphorus and nitrogen levels are improved this year. E-Coli warning only at [Location 4](/map/maps/) - level measured was 50 CFU/100ml (safe to swim if below 100, safe to drink below 10). We are missing E-coli measure for location 6, which is often high as well. Water users on Ch des Generations should act as if their measurement is approximately 50 as well, and take suitable precautions. 
* On a positive note, E-Coli levels were either not detectable or barely detectable at the other locations (2 Canada Geese nests hatched on the lake in the spring for a total of 11 geese. Keep them off your property with these ideas: [Goose action plan](/Content/water/gooseaction/)
* At Usher: report not available yet

## Water level report

* Imre and the dam volunteers at the Lac Notre Dame outlet have been managing the beavers & dam this spring and summer, trying to keep the water levels within a 20-30 cm range. He has a checklist from Quebec of the rules he must follow. Levels through the summer were fairly normal, dropping lower when there was little rain, and then going up through August. 
* Don't trespass and go hole the dam at the outlet - email info@lacnotredame.org if you have concerns, and I'll get in touch with the team.  
* The MRC has a new Waterways manager - he'll be joining a La Peche Lake Associations meeting in September to share their new approach. 
* Lisa is continuing to track water levels and work with Lac Bernard's Association to keep the outlet and streams flowing throughout the watershed. 


## Board report on program that had been planned for 2021-2022

* Buoys: Brian Cook purchased additional anchors, rope and buoys, and placed them with Jason Gunville. 
* We looked into options for adding buoys to create a 'channel' through the thickest milfoil, but couldn't see how to make that work, as Transport Canada has extensive rules about navigation buoys. We also looked at 'Slow - No Wake' buoys for the side of the island but they are $500 each and seem to only come in English. 
* Sign idea for island wasn't acted on due to island owner falling ill, not being available. Will try again this fall with the new signs. 
* A sign order is in progress to buy plastic signs similar to Lac Gauvreau - much much cheaper than metal signs and we can put them by the roads and on people's docks. 
* Water testing data has been shared with Canadian researchers through the Data Stream program. A data scientist asked us to participate, and I worked with them to groom/prepare the data. They are building up data sets across Canada and focusing on Quebec this year. [See our data on DataStream](https://greatlakesdatastream.ca/explore/#/dataset/2723088c-5c8f-4e0c-84b5-8c323e005f0a/?sort=create_timestamp&active=false&zoom=5.5&lat=47.156899397188376&lng=-72.94184398563701&guideline=&percentiles=&characteristic_media=Surface%2520Water&characteristic_characteristic_name=Total%2520Phosphorus%252C%2520mixed%2520forms&characteristic_method_speciation=as%2520P&characteristic_sample_fraction=Unfiltered&characteristic_field=false&characteristic_unit=mg%252FL&locations=241463,241458,241466,241462,241464,241461,241468,241470,241459,241457,241467,241471,241469,241465,241460)
* Blue Green Algae Plan: there is less common green algae this summer here (cool in July) and in Ottawa too according to our consulting biologist. No sign of any blue-green here. Reminder to contact Lisa at info@lacnotredame.org if you see a blue or green slick on the surface - microscope is ready.
* Boaters asking about private ramp access have been referred to Marc from Bishop's Manor Association. 
* Members asking about burlap have been sent some links on how to do it - key is to use rocks or sand from the lake to weigh down the burlap, rather than bringing in sand that may have invasive seeds/eggs in it. Apparently can order it from ULine. 

Move to accept the board and water testing report: Lisa Fast

Seconded: Bryan Watkinson

## Members open issues
* Problem with someone cutting weeds without raking, and so many floated in - we could drop a hand-out next summer - have someone in each area walk them around - Bernard and Susan on Shaw volunteer to do that for their area

* Dave Hayward, member will be replaced by Jane Hayward this year - Vote approved
* Bryan Watkinson, member (Usher Lake)
* Don Herweyer, member.
* Brian Cook, treasurer.
* Lisa Fast, President (elected July 2018)
