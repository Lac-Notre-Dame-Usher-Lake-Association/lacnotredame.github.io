## 2021 annual meeting (on Zoom August 21, 2021)

* [2021 Annual General Meeting Notes,plans & minutes](/about/2021BoardReport/)
  
## Blue-green algae watch

Reminder to watch for slicks (only occurrence so far was in small event in November 2020)

* If you can see a blue-green film on the surface of the water, take a photo to send.
* Collect a sample in a clean jar (with gloves or wash hands well afterwards).
* Put the jar in the fridge for a few hours. Common green algae will stay mixed with the water. If the algae floats in a layer at the surface, it is likely to be blue-green.
* If it does float, email the photo of the algae and its location,  and a photo of the jar to Lisa at info@lacnotredame.org We will arrange to drop it off or get it picked up so I can identify it under the microscope. If it IS blue-green, I will then send an email warning to all lake association members.

## [Water testing results](/water/qualityreports/)

The Association tests samples of water from the Lakes for phosphorus, nitrogen and E-coli on a regular basis. Volunteer Carole Doré & Rejean Vaillant collect samples for testing every year. Say Thank You when you see them!

L'association analyse régulièrement des échantillons d'eau des lacs pour le phosphore, l'azote et l'E-coli. Carole Doré et Rejean Vaillant collectes des échantillons pour les analyser depuis plus de 15 ans. Dites-leurs merci quand vous les verrez!

***2021:***  Water testing at Lac Notre Dame and Usher took place in early August. High nutrient levels from heavy July rains are a likely cause of increased milfoil in August.

* [Map of lake with water testing locations](/map/maps/)
* Association membership fees and donations fund the water testing.

## [Eurasian Milfoil](/water/lnd-milfoil/) - yellow buoys mean stay away!

In 2021, after several years of low weed levels, invasive Eurasian Milfoil once again formed a carpet on the lake's surface. New yellow buoys were purchased to mark areas with milfoil close to the surface. Your wake and motors cut up the weed - each cut piece can grow into a new plant. Stay clear of the buoys.

En 2021, après plusieurs années de faibles niveaux de mauvaises herbes, le myriophylle en épi envahissant a de nouveau formé un tapis à la surface du lac. De nouvelles bouées jaunes ont été achetées pour marquer les zones où le myriophylle est proche de la surface. Votre sillage et vos moteurs coupent l'herbe - chaque morceau coupé peut donner naissance à une nouvelle plante. Restez à l'écart des bouées.

## [Watershed map of Lac Notre Dame and Usher Lake](/map/maps/)

The map shows all inlets and outlets into the lakes. Lots are marked. Water testing locations are marked.

La carte montre toutes les entrées et sorties des lacs. Les lots sont marqués. Les lieux d'analyse de l'eau sont indiqués.

## [Canada Goose Action Plan](/water/gooseaction/)

A lawn near the shore attracts geese, nests and goose poop. Prevent geese and erosion by naturalizing your shoreline.

* Get prevention ideas for yourself and your neighbours in the [Goose Action Plan](/water/gooseaction/).

* Nous allons remettre des exemplaires du [plan d'action pour les bernaches](/water/gooseaction/) aux propriétaires.
