# Toxic Blue green algae 
 
Alarmingly, Lac Notre Dame and other area lakes have had some recent blue-green algae sightings. Some of this type of algae is dangerous for swimming, washing and drinking.

Dense blue-green algal blooms can look like green pea soup or solid-looking mats of turquoise paint. Blooms can also be other colours such as yellow, purple, red or brown.

Blue green algae can grow into substantial blooms that consume large amounts of oxygen in the water when they die and decompose, placing fish at risk too.
 
Fresh blooms smell like freshly mowed grass but older blooms can smell like rotting garbage.

## Blue-green algae can be poisonous

Not all types of blue-green algae make us sick, but some produce toxins that can cause diarrhea, vomiting, skin irritation and headaches. 
 
Imagine coming to the lake but being unable to swim, fish or otherwise enjoy the water. Thankfully, we are not there yet but we need to do all we can to avoid this future.


 
## Prevent blue-green algae in our lakes 
 
Blue green algae (and other species of algae) grow in the presence of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous.  Sources of these nutrients include leaking septic systems, lawn fertilizers, and animal waste, among others. Runoff from rainfall magnifies the harmful impact of these sources.
 
You can make a difference in our fight for a healthy lake:
 
* Avoid using lawn fertilizers on your property, especially if natural plants and shrubs have been removed from your shoreline
* Leave at least 5 metres near the shore unmowed 
* Plant native species on your shoreline to absorb and filter  nutrients before they are washed into the lake by rain   
* Keep your septic system in good repair, and pump out as needed, or at minimum every 2 years for permanent residents and every 4 years for seasonal residents, per Quebec rules
* Reduce the wake produced by your boat 


## Do a jar test if you suspect blue-green algae

If you see a blue-green film (looks like paint or pollen) floating on the surface of the water, follow these steps: 

1. Take a photo and send it to info@lacnotredame.org, tell us where it is - avoid swimming near the bloom, keep children and pets away, and if it is within 3m of your water intake, stop drinking the water
2. Use a clean jar and fill it about 3/4 full with water from the film and just below it, use gloves and wash your hands and wipe the outside of the jar afterwards
3. Place the jar in the fridge to let the contents settle
4. After two hours, take a look at the jar in the fridge - if the algae has floated up to the surface and is forming a ring, or is in a layer at the top, it is likely blue-green algae. Send another email to report the results of your test. We'll send an email to warn all members. 

## Positive jar test - Jar with ring of blue-green algae at the surface - Lac Notre Dame, 2020


## Negative jar test - Jar with regular non-toxic algae that has not floated up to the surface  - Lac Notre Dame, 2021

5. Follow Quebec's advice on how long to avoid the area, and what to do if you have symptoms of exposure.
