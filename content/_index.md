## [Water testing results](/water/qualityreports/)

The Association tests samples of water from the Lakes for phosphorus, nitrogen and E-coli on a regular basis. Volunteer and Lake Association member Carol Doré has collected samples for testing for over 10 years. Say Thank You when you see her! Your membership fees fund the testing. 

2017 Summary: In August of 2017, at the end of a very rainy summer, all measurements were at or below the target levels for a healthy lake - except for some higher e-coli bacteria counts in samples at Usher Lake. These results may be from beavers in the area, or from human activity. Water clarity in Lac Notre-Dame was lower than normal, as expected with high rain and run-off.

## [Protect the clean water we enjoy](/water/keepclean/)

We all enjoy the lake's beautiful clean water. To keep them clean, each of us can keep soap, fertilizer and other contaminants out of the water, and preserve the natural shoreline. We've pulled together a handy sheet of tips to share with all lake residents and guests.  

* [View and print tips to keep our lakes clean](/water/keepclean/) for your family and for your guests. 

Eurasian milfoil weed appeared in the lake over ten years ago. Some years, it can form a dense carpet on the lake's surface, crowding out the indigenous plant species and harming fish populations. It's an invasive species, brought in on someone's boat or fishing equipment. Each tiny piece broken off by waves or boats can turn into a new plant. Remove any you cut, and keep your boat out of weedy areas.
