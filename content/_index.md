## 2018 Lake Association Meeting

The meeting was on August 18th at Rupert Hall, to discuss ideas and concerns about the lakes, water quality and the watershed.

* [Agenda - will be edited into the minutes of the meeting](/about/2018boardreport/)
* Geese driving you crazy? Cathie K. sent in these ideas for fencing - [How to keep geese off your waterfront property (PDF)](http://lacducardinal.ca/articles/Geese.pdf)

## [Watershed map of Lac Notre Dame and Usher Lake](/map/maps/)

The map shows all inlets and outlets into the lakes. Lots are marked. Water testing locations are marked.

## [Water testing results](/water/qualityreports/)

The Association tests samples of water from the Lakes for phosphorus, nitrogen and E-coli on a regular basis. Volunteer and Lake Association member Carol Doré has collected samples for testing for over 10 years. Say Thank You when you see her!

***2018 Update:***  August 13th water chemistry tests showed high e-coli in one sample at location 6 and at Usher inlets. E-coli results were back to normal a few days later when a new set of samples were tested from a range of points around location 6 in front of Generations & Symons.  Nitrogen and phosphate levels are normal. Water clarity tests show a return to our more usual clarity levels of above 5.0 metres.

Very low levels of Eurasian Milfoil in the lake in early August, and by mid-August, the area marked by buoys has almost no milfoil at all - native plants have re-established themselves there.

* [Map of lake with water testing locations](/map/maps/)
* Association membership fees fund the water testing.

## [Protect the clean water we enjoy](/water/keepclean/)

Keep our water clean. We've pulled together a handy sheet of tips to share and are delivering them dock to dock this summer of 2018. Share them with your renters - binder page version available.

* [View and print tips to keep our lakes clean](/water/keepclean/) for your family and for your guests.

Some years, invasive Eurasian Milfoil forms a dense carpet on the lake's surface, crowding out the indigenous plant species and harming fish. It was brought in on someone's boat or fishing equipment. Each tiny piece broken off by waves or boats can turn into a new plant.
