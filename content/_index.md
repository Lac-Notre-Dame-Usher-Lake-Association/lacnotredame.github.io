## 2020 Annual meeting will be August 22 at 10:00 a.m.
Due to the pandemic, we'll be meeting online this year. Zoom link will be set up in late July and emailed to past and current members. We are working on a new payment method for membership fees due in August. 

Board members met with other La Peche lake associations on July 11 and with the municipality- notes from that meeting coming soon.  
* Last year: [2019 Annual General Meeting Minutes](/about/2019boardreport/) 

## [Canada Goose Action Plan](/water/gooseaction/)

An adult goose can produce as much as a kilo of poop every day, and those droppings can contaminate our water - and your property. 6 more geese hatched at the lake this year, thankfully fewer than in 2018 and 2019.

* Keep geese away by naturalizing your shoreline or putting up goose barriers. If there is no access to your lawn, they won't stay.
* Get barrier ideas for yourself and your neighbours in our[Goose Action Plan](/water/gooseaction/).   

Une bernache adulte peut produire jusqu'à un kilo de caca tous les jours, et ces excréments peuvent contaminer notre eau - et votre propriété. Nous avons créé un plan d’action pour le lac afin de minimiser les dégâts. 

* L'accent est mis sur la naturalisation de votre rivage.
* Nous allons remettre des exemplaires du [plan d'action](/water/gooseaction/) aux propriétaires.

## [Water testing results](/water/qualityreports/)

The Association tests samples of water from the Lakes for phosphorus, nitrogen and E-coli on a regular basis. Volunteer and Lake Association member Carole Doré has collected samples for testing for over 10 years. Say Thank You when you see her!

***2020:***  Water testing will take place first week of August.       

* [See the 2019 summary and all water data back to 2004](/water/qualityreports/) and a 2014 study of the Lake ecosystem by ABV-7
* [Map of lake with water testing locations](/map/maps/)
* Association membership fees fund the water testing.

## [Protect the clean water we enjoy](/water/keepclean/)

Keep our water clean. Share the tip sheet with your renters - binder page version available.

* [View and print tips to keep our lakes clean](/water/keepclean/) for your family and for your guests.

Some years, invasive Eurasian Milfoil forms a dense carpet on the lake's surface, crowding out the indigenous plant species and harming fish. It was brought in on someone's boat or fishing equipment. Each tiny piece broken off by waves or boats can turn into a new plant. 

*** 2020 *** We're starting from high water in June and very low milfoil levels in 2018-2019. We hope the native weeds can maintain the areas they re-established That said, there is still lots of milfoil - do cut and most importantly, remove the cuttings and remove cuttings that float in to your waterfront.

## [Watershed map of Lac Notre Dame and Usher Lake](/map/maps/)
