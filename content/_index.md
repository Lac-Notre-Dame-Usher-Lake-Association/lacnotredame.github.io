## [Watershed map of Lac Notre Dame and Usher Lake](/map/maps/)

The map shows all inlets and outlets into the lakes. Lots are marked. Water testing locations are marked. 

## [Water testing results](/water/qualityreports/)

The Association tests samples of water from the Lakes for phosphorus, nitrogen and E-coli on a regular basis. Volunteer and Lake Association member Carol Doré has collected samples for testing for over 10 years. Say Thank You when you see her! 

***2018 Update:*** Water clarity tests show a return to our more usual clarity levels of above 5.0 metres. Very low levels of Eurasian Milfoil in the lake so far (early August). Testing results not in yet.  

* [See detailed recent and historical water quality reports](/water/qualityreports/) and a 2014 study of the Lake ecosystem by ABV-7
* [Map of lake with water testing locations](/map/maps/)
* Association membership fees fund the water testing. 

## [Protect the clean water we enjoy](/water/keepclean/)

Keep our water clean. We've pulled together a handy sheet of tips to share and are delivering them dock to dock this summer of 2018. Share them with your renters - binder page version available.   

* [View and print tips to keep our lakes clean](/water/keepclean/) for your family and for your guests. 

Some years, invasive Eurasian Milfoil forms a dense carpet on the lake's surface, crowding out the indigenous plant species and harming fish. It was brought in on someone's boat or fishing equipment. Each tiny piece broken off by waves or boats can turn into a new plant.
