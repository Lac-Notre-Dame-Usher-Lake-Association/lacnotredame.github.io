## [Water testing results](/qualityreports/)
The Association tests samples of water from the Lakes for phosphorus, nitrogen and E-coli on a regular basis. Volunteer and Lake Association member Carol Doré has collected samples for testing for over 10 years. 

2017 Summary: In August of 2017, at the end of a very rainy summer, all measurements were at or below the target levels for a healthy lake - except for some higher bacteria counts for e-coli in samples at Usher Lake. These results may be from beavers in the area, or from human activity.
