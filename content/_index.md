## [Water testing results](/qualityreports/)

The Association tests samples of water from the Lakes for phosphorus, nitrogen and E-coli on a regular basis. Volunteer and Lake Association member Carol Doré has collected samples for testing for over 10 years. 

2017 Summary: In August of 2017, at the end of a very rainy summer, all measurements were at or below the target levels for a healthy lake - except for some higher bacteria counts for e-coli in samples at Usher Lake. These results may be from beavers in the area, or from human activity.

## [Tips to keep our lakes clean](/keepclean/)

We all enjoy the lake's beautiful clean water. To keep them clean, each of us can keep soap, fertilizer and other contaminants out of the water, and preserve the natural shoreline. We've pulled together a handy sheet of tips to share with all lake residents and guests.

The Eurasian milfoil weed appeared in the lake over ten years ago. It's an invasive species, brought in on someone's boat or fishing equipment. Each tiny piece broken off by waves or boats can turn into a new plant. Some years, it can form a dense carpet on the lake's surface, crowding out the indigenous plant species and harming fish populations.
