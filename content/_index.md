## Canada Goose Action Plan

An email to all members and previous members went out April 24th from info@lacnotredame.org. It outlined our Goose Action Plan:   

* We will prepare and deliver a handout focused on preventing the geese from getting onto your shore, and on naturalizing your shore line. Natural shorelines with tall grass, trees and shrubs prevent the geese from feeding on your lawn (if you have one), and also protect the lake from erosion and run-off.  
* The geese are back - family of 4 adults and 5 goslings are present. Our many attempts to find nests & prevent the hatch in May failed - tricky to find them in the swamp.  
* Contact us by email at info@lacnotredame.org if you want help with the geese on your property. A number of lake owners are having some prevention success. 
* See [Environment Canada's Handbook on Managing Geese](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/migratory-bird-conservation/publications/handbook-managing-cackling-geese-southern/chapter-3.html#_toc07010201) for ideas on scaring, preventing the hatch, and fences. 

## [Water testing results](/water/qualityreports/)

The Association tests samples of water from the Lakes for phosphorus, nitrogen and E-coli on a regular basis. Volunteer and Lake Association member Carole Doré has collected samples for testing for over 10 years. Say Thank You when you see her!

***2019:***  Water testing will take place in early August. Water levels are very high - please keep motor boats far from shore to reduce erosion and damage to docks.

* [See recent reports and all water data back to 2005](/water/qualityreports/) and a 2014 study of the Lake ecosystem by ABV-7
* [Map of lake with water testing locations](/map/maps/)
* Association membership fees fund the water testing.

## [Protect the clean water we enjoy](/water/keepclean/)

Keep our water clean. We pulled together a handy sheet of tips to share and delivered them dock to dock in 2019. Share them with your renters - binder page version available.

* [View and print tips to keep our lakes clean](/water/keepclean/) for your family and for your guests.

Some years, invasive Eurasian Milfoil forms a dense carpet on the lake's surface, crowding out the indigenous plant species and harming fish. It was brought in on someone's boat or fishing equipment. Each tiny piece broken off by waves or boats can turn into a new plant.

## [Watershed map of Lac Notre Dame and Usher Lake](/map/maps/)

The map shows all inlets and outlets into the lakes. Lots are marked. Water testing locations are marked.
