## [Water testing results](/water/qualityreports/)

The Association tests samples of water from the Lakes for phosphorus, nitrogen and E-coli on a regular basis. Volunteer and Lake Association member Carole Doré has collected samples for testing for over 15 years. Say Thank You when you see her!

L'association analyse régulièrement des échantillons d'eau des lacs pour le phosphore, l'azote et l'E-coli. Carole Doré collecte des échantillons pour les analyser depuis plus de 10 ans. Dites-lui merci quand vous la verrez!

## Eurasian Milfoil - keep your boats out of the Zombie Weed
Some years, invasive Eurasian Milfoil forms a dense carpet on the lake's surface, crowding out the indigenous plant species and harming fish. It was brought in on someone's boat or fishing equipment in the 1990's. It's a Zombie Weed: each tiny piece broken off by waves or boats can turn into a new plant. 

Certaines années, le myriophylle envahissant forme un tapis dense à la surface du lac, évinçant les espèces végétales indigènes et nuisant aux poissons. Il a été introduit sur le bateau ou l'équipement de pêche de quelqu'un dans les années 1990. Chaque petit morceau brisé par les vagues ou les bateaux peut se transformer en une nouvelle plante. 

*** 2020 *** Bouys were placed in early August to keep boats out of the milfoil just under the surface in area 5.

## [Watershed map of Lac Notre Dame and Usher Lake](/map/maps/)

The map shows all inlets and outlets into the lakes. Lots are marked. Water testing locations are marked.

La carte montre toutes les entrées et sorties des lacs. Les lots sont marqués. Les lieux d'analyse de l'eau sont indiqués.

## [Canada Goose Action Plan](/water/gooseaction/)

An adult goose can produce as much as a kilo of poop every day, and those droppings can contaminate our water - and your property. 6 more geese hatched at the lake this year, thankfully fewer than in 2018 and 2019.
