## 2020 plans from our annual meeting
Our annual meeting was held August 24 - great discussions and input to this year's plans. Thanks to all the lake members who came out. Water testing results were discussed in detail and the Goose Action plan hand out was available to all. 
* Board report and plans in the [2019 Annual General Meeting Minutes](/about/2019boardreport/) 

## [Canada Goose Action Plan](/water/gooseaction/)

An adult goose can produce as much as a kilo of poop every day, and those droppings can contaminate our water - and your property. We’ve created an action plan for the lake to minimize the damage. 

* Best thing to do is naturalize your shoreline. If there is no access to your lawn, they won't stay.
* We'll be delivering copies of the [Action Plan](/water/gooseaction/) to lake owners with lawns at the water's edge who haven't put up goose barriers.   

Une bernache adulte peut produire jusqu'à un kilo de caca tous les jours, et ces excréments peuvent contaminer notre eau - et votre propriété. Nous avons créé un plan d’action pour le lac afin de minimiser les dégâts. 

* L'accent est mis sur la naturalisation de votre rivage.
* Nous allons remettre des exemplaires du [plan d'action](/water/gooseaction/) aux propriétaires.

## [Water testing results](/water/qualityreports/)

The Association tests samples of water from the Lakes for phosphorus, nitrogen and E-coli on a regular basis. Volunteer and Lake Association member Carole Doré has collected samples for testing for over 10 years. Say Thank You when you see her!

***2019:***  Water testing results are in - E-Coli is a bit higher than previous years and there are some phosphate concerns.      

* [See the 2019 summary and all water data back to 2005](/water/qualityreports/) and a 2014 study of the Lake ecosystem by ABV-7
* [Map of lake with water testing locations](/map/maps/)
* Association membership fees fund the water testing.

## [Protect the clean water we enjoy](/water/keepclean/)

Keep our water clean. We pulled together a handy sheet of tips to share and delivered them dock to dock in 2018. Share them with your renters - binder page version available.

* [View and print tips to keep our lakes clean](/water/keepclean/) for your family and for your guests.

Some years, invasive Eurasian Milfoil forms a dense carpet on the lake's surface, crowding out the indigenous plant species and harming fish. It was brought in on someone's boat or fishing equipment. Each tiny piece broken off by waves or boats can turn into a new plant. 

*** 2019 *** Overall milfoil levels are lower than other years, likely due to the cold wet spring and high water levels through July. Buoys were not placed as those areas did not have weeds thick and high enough to reach boat motors this year. Native weeds have returned in many areas. That said, there is still lots of milfoil - do cut and most importantly, remove the cuttings.

## [Watershed map of Lac Notre Dame and Usher Lake](/map/maps/)

The map shows all inlets and outlets into the lakes. Lots are marked. Water testing locations are marked.
