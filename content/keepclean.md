## Help us keep the Lakes clean with these tips

### It’s not a garden – don't dump ashes, fertilizer, or anything at all into the lake. 

* Do cut then remove the invasive Eurasian milfoil. Avoid pulling up weeds or doing anything to stir up the bottom. 

### There are shallow areas choked with milfoil - stay clear of them.  

* Lake Association volunteers place buoys out each sprint to mark areas with heavy milfoil. 

* Your boat motor chops up milfoil into tiny pieces. All those pieces can grow roots, creating more milfoil than before your boat went through. 

### It’s not a bathtub or toilet – no soap, waste or pee.

* We test our water every summer & alert you if there is a problem near your property. 

### It’s not a speedway – boat wakes increase erosion.

* Let’s all slow down & not make waves. 

### It’s easy to contaminate. Milfoil was brought in on someone’s boat – we worry Zebra mussels are next.

* Wash your boat & equipment before you put in.

## Cut and remove your Milfoil
The Lake Association encourages residents to cut milfoil themselves and remove the cuttings. Milfoil bits may also drift in that have been cut up by boat motors, and lake residents are encouraged to remove them from the lake (they make good compost). 
 
* Cutting tools – Some residents have purchased Weed shears and/or Aquatic Weed Eradicator cutters for personal use or shared use from this site: https://canadianpond.ca/product/aquatic-weed-rakes-cutters/
