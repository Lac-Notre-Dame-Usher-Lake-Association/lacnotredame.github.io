Carol Doré has been volunteering as the Association water tester for years. Thank her when you see her! She collects and tests the water on a regular basis for phosphorus, nitrogen and also for e-coli bacterial contamination. 

## Latest water testing results

Phosphate run-off from fertilizers, detergents and waste can act as a fertilizer for plants and algae in the lake, and can reduce the oxygen content. Target levels for an uncontaminated lake are below .005 mg/L. Our lakes have so far been relatively uncontaminated, although levels occasionaly creep up above the target.  

* Phosphorus levels in Notre Dame and Usher lakes in August 2017 were 0.006 to 0.017 mg/L - fairly close to the target range. 

Nitrogen and nitrates occur naturally in soil and water, but lawn and garden fertilizers leaching into the water can make it unsafe for drinking and upset the natural ecosystem. Target levels for nitrogen in drinking water are 0.02 mg/L. Levels in our lakes are higher than those targets. * Need more detail on this -drinking versus lake water. 

* Nitrogen levels in August 2017 ranged from 0.19 to 0.52 mg/L. 

E.coli is a bacterium that can cause severe illness. The presence of E. coli in water is a strong indication of recent sewage or animal waste contamination. The safety target for e-coli is a level below 4 CFU - Colony Forming Units in 100 ml of water. 

* E-coli levels in Lac Notre Dame in 2017 were are or below the target of 4 CFU/100ml , but in Usher Lake in late August, there was evidence of contamination. Levels on August 29th in Usher Lake ranged from 15 to 25 - well above the target range of less than 5 CFU/100 ml. 

To understand the in-depth results, these [Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life](/assets/docs/water/water_quality_guidelines.pdf) provide some target levels. 

Water transparency is an indicator of lake health - clear, more transparent water is a sign of a healthy lake. 

* Water transparency tests with the Secchi disk were performed in July 2017 by Lisa Fast, with help from Denis Corbeil. The measurement in the deepest part of the lake at Association location #9 was 3.75 meters. A similar reading of 3.75 was measured in late September. This is below the average reading of 4 to 5m.  In 2015, a 7m measurement was recorded at the same location but that month Ottawa received only 40mm of rain.  

* Water levels in the lake were very high in 2017 due to record-level rainfall. Ottawa’s total rainfall for July 2017 was 249.8 mm – the most since recording began at the Ottawa Airport in 1938. Cooler summer weather played a role as well (not a single day above 30 degrees in July). This year’s rainfall has brought in a lot of sediment, and high water levels have eroded the shoreline as well.

## 2014 ABV-7 Report and recommendations 
 
In 2014, the Municipality of La Pêche, with the Association, worked with ABV-7 to produce a report on the shoreline and water of Lac Notre Dame. A translated summary and tables of water testing results are provided below - the report is in French.

ABV-7 was mandated in June 2014 by the Municipality of La Pêche to characterize the shoreline of Lake Notre-Dame, assess the physico-chemical quality of the water and delimit the milfoil meadows on the lake. This information provided a picture of the current situation in order to slow down the eutrophication of the lake and combat its invasion by Eurasian water milfoil. 

Eutrophication is the gradual process of a lake becoming too rich in nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. The nutrients feed the cycle of plant and algae growth, which over time, can result in oxygen depletion. 

The protocol of the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (MDDEP) (currently MDDELCC) and the Laurentian Regional Environment Council (CRE Laurentides) (2007) was used to characterize the riparian strip. With respect to the assessment of water quality, ABV des 7 collected and analyzed data on total phosphorus and Escherichia coli (E. coli) provided by the Notre-Dame Lakes Association. and Usher (2005 to 2011 and 2013) as well as by the municipality (2008 to 2013). In addition, ABV des 7 collected and analyzed data on the concentration and dissolved oxygen saturation, pH, depth and conductivity of water acquired during field visits on 17 July 2014. L ABV des 7 subsequently identified and mapped the water-milfoil meadows on 3 September 2014.
