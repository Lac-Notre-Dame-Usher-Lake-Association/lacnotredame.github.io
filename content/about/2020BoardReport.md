### Water testing report 

[Water testing report](/water/qualityreports/) presented by Lisa Fast

* Thank you to Carole Doré for her continued volunteer work on water testing. Water testing samples were collected August 10th. Samples from Usher and another sample from Location 6 near Des Generation are expected the week of August 23.  
* Water testing results summaries are now published on the web site when they are received, and all of the years of data are available for comparison and viewing. Biologist Paul Hamilton reviews the reports and implications. 


## Board report on program that had been planned for 2019-2020
* The Pandemic disrupted our program, delaying the return to the lake for many of us, and generally making things more difficult.  
* Develop a Blue Green Algae prevention and action plan to understand, prevent and prepare if it appears (for example, add Dissolved Organic Compound (DOC) test to water testing suite) - Investigated how to test for Blue Green Algae and discussed testing issues with other lake associations. Added DOC to testing, and DOC results for 2020 are good, similar to Arctic Lakes, according to biologist. Also same range as in 2005, indicating lake has not progressed in eutrophication. We may only test this every few years given lack of change over last 15 years. 
* Suggestion to investigate and prepare a hand-out/tip sheet about fire pits, and handling of ashes. We did not complete this action, due to the pandemic. 
* Met with the other lake associations of La Peche to discuss milfoil actions. Agreed that an all-of-La-Peche sign and hand-out approach is preferred to the many different signs and messages around the lakes - two members will be applying for a grant to do this. Other lakes have had severe milfoil mats over the last few years (Gauvreau in particular) - we shared water testing results and ideas for cutting. La Peche retained ABV-7 to study the interaction of boats and milfoil spread. The report is available online at [villelapeche report](http://www.villelapeche.qc.ca/downloads/ . 2020-07-20%20Rapport-impact-bateaux-sur-myriophylle.pdf)
* Develop a better understanding of the changing water levels and the potential impact of the new larger culverts at the outlet next spring - water levels may be lower as a result, thus bringing a surge in milfoil growth. Lisa began tracking water levels in photographs, understanding historical levels and capturing levels in greater detai: [Water level report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G-21C_dnWKis5s0IH6O8lTlRtHkBAFrfbBYEbdw8lVA/edit?usp=sharing) 
  
  Move to accept the board and water testing report: 

  Seconded: 

## Boat launch Committee report - M. Desrochers


## Current board and election of new members

We request new members for the board. We meet 2-3 times per year plus the AGM. 

Dave Hayward no longer wishes to act as Treasurer but will remain on the board. New treasurer? 
Role requires management of the bank account, signing cheques, accepting interac payments, produce summary at end of year

* Lisa Fast, President (elected July 2018)
* Robert Boucher, Vice-president
* Dave Hayward, Treasurer
* Erin Jamison (Usher Lake representative)
* Marie Maissoneuve 
* André François Giroux 
* Danielle Doré 

## Members open issues
* 2 of the flagged buoys that identify why the buoys are there were lost in 2018 - we should plan for replacements. 
* B. Watkinson - concerned about calcium road spray seeping into the lake, especially on the stretch of Manoir on the south side of the lake where the pumping station is. The road is very close to the water there
  

## Proposed Association program for 2020-2021
* Plan for replacement buoys
* Perhaps we should develop and agree on water level strategy - adopt some indicators/signals
