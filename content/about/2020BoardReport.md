### Water testing report 

[Water testing report](/water/qualityreports/) presented by Lisa Fast

* Thank you to Carole Doré for her continued volunteer work on water testing. Water testing samples were collected August 10th. Samples from Usher and another sample from Location 6 near Des Generation are expected the week of August 23.  
* Water testing results summaries are now published on the web site when they are received, and all of the years of data are available for comparison and viewing. Biologist Paul Hamilton reviews the reports and implications. 


## Board report on program that had been planned for 2019-2020
* The Pandemic disrupted our program, delaying the return to the lake for many of us, and generally making things more difficult.  
* Develop a Blue Green Algae prevention and action plan to understand, prevent and prepare if it appears (for example, add Dissolved Organic Compound (DOC) test to water testing suite) - Investigated how to test for Blue Green Algae and discussed testing issues with other lake associations. Added DOC to testing, and DOC results for 2020 are good, similar to Arctic Lakes, according to biologist. Also same range as in 2005, indicating lake has not progressed in eutrophication. We may only test this every few years given lack of change over last 15 years. 
* Suggestion to investigate and prepare a hand-out/tip sheet about fire pits, and handling of ashes. We did not complete this action, due to the pandemic. 
* Met with the other lake associations of La Peche to discuss milfoil actions. Agreed that an all-of-La-Peche sign and hand-out approach is preferred to the many different signs and messages around the lakes - two members will be applying for a grant to do this. Other lakes have had severe milfoil mats over the last few years (Gauvreau in particular) - we shared water testing results and ideas for cutting. La Peche retained ABV-7 to study the interaction of boats and milfoil spread. The report is available online at [villelapeche report](http://www.villelapeche.qc.ca/downloads/ . 2020-07-20%20Rapport-impact-bateaux-sur-myriophylle.pdf)
* Develop a better understanding of the changing water levels and the potential impact of the new larger culverts at the outlet next spring - water levels may be lower as a result, thus bringing a surge in milfoil growth. Lisa began tracking water levels in photographs, understanding historical levels and capturing levels in greater detai: [Water level report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G-21C_dnWKis5s0IH6O8lTlRtHkBAFrfbBYEbdw8lVA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Boat launch Committee report - M. Desrochers, President, Bishop's Manor Association
About a third of property owners on Lac Notre Dame are also members of the Bishop's Manor Association. Bishop's Manor association members pay dues for road maintenance & other subdivision activities per the deeds of their property.  

Marc Desrochers reported that the Bishop's Manor Association has (re)purchased the property along the causeway on Ch. du Manoir. Ch. Du Manoir was previously part of Bishop's Manor private road system, but it became a public road in 2009. The Municipality required an environmental assessment as part of the permit process for using the property as a private boat launch. A biologist performed the assessment in July, and a permit may be approved in September. Marc hopes to have a functioning launch area for the fall boat removal. 

The intent is that all property owners on the lake, and Bishop's Manor Association members, will have access to the launch in spring and fall via some kind of combination lock. It was acknowledged that some people do circumvent the current concrete blocks and put boats in for the day. A gate and fence will hopefully prevent that kind of day-access, and thus prevent the entry of further invasive species like zebra mussels and freshwater jellyfish.  

Meeting participants agreed that communication and education about boat washing, wakes, and avoiding milfoil areas should be part of access to the boat launch. We agreed to add this education/communication to our Association projects for this winter. Marc will keep in touch via email, and we can use the email list and website for communication about the launch. 

## Current board and election of new members

We request new members for the board. We meet 2-3 times per year plus the AGM. 

Changes, new members and resignations: 
* Dave Hayward no longer wishes to act as Treasurer but will remain on the board. 
* André François Giroux will be out of the country for 4 years, so offered to either remain on the board if needed or resign for that period. Since there are new members, we accept the resignation and wish he and Nathalie bon voyage! 
* Danielle Doré resigned from the board but will continue to do the buoys, and assist with education

* Bryan Watkinson offered to rejoin the board. 
* Don Herweyer offered to join the board. 
* Brian Cook offered to join the board as treasurer. 

* Lisa Fast, President (elected July 2018) 
* Robert Boucher, Vice-president 
* Dave Hayward 
* Erin Jamison (Usher Lake representative)  
* Marie Maissoneuve 

Lisa moved to vote to approve adding Bryan, Don and Brian as new members of the board, and to have Brian take on the treasurer role. 
The motion was approved - 21 Yays - 0 nays.  

## Members open issues
* Bryan Watkinson - concerned about calcium road spray seeping into the lake, especially on the stretch of Manoir on the south side of the lake where the pumping station is. The road is very close to the water there
  

## Proposed Association program for 2020-2021
* Plan for replacement buoys. 2 of the flagged buoys that identify why the buoys are there were lost in 2018 - we should plan for replacements. Carolle Peras also suggested that more buoys should be added to protect other areas. Carolle has offered to help with applying for a grant over this winter if one is needed. 
 * * Lisa added that with the growth in paid members this year, we may be able to access additional funding from the municipality that is specifically for lake associations and is based on the number of members. 
* The board will develop and agree on a water level strategy - adopt some indicators/signals, find out what we can do about beavers on private property. 
* Boater education action plan - we agreed that the boat launch will be a great opportunity to educate boat owners about their role in maintaining a healthy enjoyable lake.
