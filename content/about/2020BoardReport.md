### Water testing report 

[Water testing report](https://lacnotredame.org/water/qualityreports/) presented by Lisa Fast

* Thank you to Carole Doré for her continued volunteer work on water testing. Water testing samples were collected August 10th. 
* Water testing results summaries are now published on the web site when they are received, and all of the years of data are available for comparison and viewing. Biologist Paul Hamilton reviews the reports and implications. 
* Milfoil is higher this year than in 2019. Buoys were placed out on August 5 after several board members noticed cuttings floating and that milfoil was within range of boat motors. An email was sent to the list of members warning that the buoys were out, and members were asked to alert new neighbours who may not be aware of why the buoys are present. 2 of the flagged buoys that identify WHY the buoys are there were lost in 2018 - we should plan for replacements. 


## Board report of program for 2019-2020
* Develop a Blue Green Algae prevention and action plan to understand, prevent and prepare if it appears (for example, add Dissolved Organic Compound (DOC) test to water testing suite) - we added DOC to this year's testing, and found and added DOC values into the test spreadsheet from 2005-2006 for comparison. Investigated how to test for Blue Green Algae and discussed testing issues with other lake associations. DOC results for 2020 are good, similar to Arctic Lakes, according to biologist. Also same range as in 2005, indicating lake has not progressed in eutrophication. We may only test this every few years given lack of change over last 15 years. 
* Suggestion to investigate and prepare a hand-out/tip sheet about fire pits, and handling of ashes. We did not complete this action, due to the pandemic. 
* Met with the other lake associations of La Peche to discuss milfoil actions. Agreed that an all-of-La-Peche sign and hand-out approach is preferred to the many different signs and messages around the lakes - two members will be applying for a grant to do this. Other lakes have had severe milfoil mats over the last few years (Gauvreau in particular) - we shared water testing results and ideas for cutting. La Peche retained ABV-7 to study the interaction of boats and milfoil spread. The report is available online at [villelapeche report](http://www.villelapeche.qc.ca/downloads/ . 2020-07-20%20Rapport-impact-bateaux-sur-myriophylle.pdf)
* Develop a better understanding of the changing water levels and the potential impact of the new larger culverts at the outlet next spring - water levels may be lower as a result, thus bringing a surge in milfoil growth. Lisa began tracking water levels in photographs, understanding historical levels and capturing levels in greater detai: [Water level report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G-21C_dnWKis5s0IH6O8lTlRtHkBAFrfbBYEbdw8lVA/edit?usp=sharing)
