### Water testing report 

[Water testing report](https://lacnotredame.org/water/qualityreports/)

* Thank you to Carole Doré for her continued volunteer work on water testing.
* Water testing results summaries are now published on the web site when they are received by Lisa Fast, and all of the years of data are available for comparison and viewing. 
* Biologist Paul Hamilton reviews the reports and implications. This year, he warns us to watch for Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria), which may take the ecological niche the milfoil was holding. 

 

## Board report of program for 2018-2019
* Develop a position and understand full costs, responsibilities and benefits of joining Quebec’s- Réseau de surveillance volontaire des lacs (RSVL) - Voluntary Lake Monitoring Network
  * Position: do not join
  * Costs $476 per year, only tests 1 location – we test 15 for more chemicals
  * Requires clarity testing every 2 weeks from May to October (!! Who would volunteer to do this??) – we test once/twice per year and find very little variability
  * RSVL does not test for e-coli – only for phosphorus (we test for this), chlorophyll and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) – neither of which we currently test for. 
  * Action Lisa: find out how much it would cost to add a Chlorophyll and DOC test for one sample. Estimate is $40 for Dissolved Organic Carbon
*	Decide whether to maintain Facebook page now that new web site is up 
  * NO – 2017 was last notification. Suggest taking it down – or could the web site be linked. Robert should make a post with a link to the website. 
*	Decide whether to buy a Lake Association cutter and rake that people could borrow for their property or to publish a list of who has cutters they are willing to share
  * We have no insurance. Instead we recommend that neighbours gather together to purchase a cutter, like the group on the peninsula did many years ago.  
* Produce Goose Action Plan and distribute. Search for nests in early spring. 
  *	Goose Action Plan distribution to properties with lawns & no goose control is planned for late August and September. 
  *	Usher Lake has been naturalized – no geese this year. 
* Members of the Lake Association were interested in working with the Bishop's Manor Association on a boat launch solution outside of the Lake Association.
  * We used our new email list to ask our members to join together to work with the Bishop's Manor Association on a boat launch solution - the meeting was held earlier this summer.
