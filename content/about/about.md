# The Association and what we do
 The mission of the Association is to promote, protect and preserve the quality of Lac Notre Dame and Usher Lake and the watershed environment of the Lakes to ensure their continued use and enjoyment by all. 


## Annual general meetings

People from around the lakes attend the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to discuss water quality issues that have risen, to suggest changes or volunteer for a particular activity, and to vote on Association plans and board roles for the upcoming year. This is a chance to meet interested volunteers, to find out about water testing and to pay your membership fees to support the association's work. Fees were reduced from $20 per year per person to $10 per year per household in 2017.
