## Area and roads 

From La Municipalité de La Pêche road map http://www.villelapeche.qc.ca/en/municipality/aboutroad-map/

## Association water testing locations 
This map shows the numbered locations where water is collected for testing.  Carol Doré has been the volunteer water tester for many years - make sure to say "Thank you" next time you see her! 
This is a temporary image - better version in progress.
